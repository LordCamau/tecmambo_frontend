      "WhatsApp is introducing usernames, and starting this week you can reserve the one you want ahead of a full launch later in 2026. The reservation is optional and takes a few seconds, but with billions of people likely to want a clean, memorable handle, the good ones will go fast.",
      "Here is the simple version of what this changes. Today, to message someone on WhatsApp you generally need their phone number. A number is personal, it is tied to a lot of your life, and handing it to a classmate, a neighbour, a Marketplace buyer, or a group admin you have never met can feel like more than you want to share. A username lets people reach you without ever seeing your number.",
      "That matters in group chats too. You might want to join the parents' chat or a community group without giving your number to a room full of strangers. With a username, you can.",
      "WhatsApp says more than three billion people use the app, so a lot of names overlap. That is why reservations are opening early, to give everyone a fair shot at the handle they want before someone else takes it. If you are stuck for ideas, WhatsApp offers a username generator to suggest one.",
      "The privacy design is the interesting part. There is no public directory to browse and no suggestions, so people will need to know your exact username to contact you for the first time. WhatsApp has also built an optional username key, an extra detail someone must know before they can message you, so you stay in control of who can reach you. Once usernames launch, the first time you message a person or business, they will no longer see your phone number, as long as you have turned your username on.",
      "For creators, small businesses, and organisations that want a consistent identity across apps, WhatsApp has reserved an option to claim your existing Instagram or Facebook username on WhatsApp, so your handle can match the one people already know.",
      "To reserve yours, update to the latest version of WhatsApp and go to Settings, then Account, then Username. WhatsApp says it will roll the feature out gradually over the coming months and will notify you in the app when usernames go live in your country.",
      "So, should you care? If you value your privacy, or if you run anything on WhatsApp, a business, a hustle, a community, this is one of the more useful changes the app has made in a while, because it finally separates let me reach you from here is my number."

    subhead: "Device financing can help buyers access better gear, but the fine print decides whether the deal is fair.",
    excerpt: "Pay-later gadget offers are spreading because they solve a real cash-flow problem, but buyers need the total cost in plain sight.",
    whyItMatters:
      "A low deposit can hide a high final price. Clear comparisons help buyers separate useful financing from expensive pressure.",
    body: [
      "A phone or laptop paid over several months can make sense when the device helps someone study, work, or earn. The problem starts when the shelf price, deposit, fees, and penalties are shown in different places.",
      "For retailers, financing increases the number of people who can say yes. For customers, it only works when the full repayment amount is visible before the first payment is made.",
      "The better version of this market is boring in the best way: clear prices, clear deadlines, and no surprise lockouts."

    subhead: "As phones last longer, repair access is becoming part of the buying decision, not an afterthought.",
    excerpt: "Brands that make batteries, screens, and diagnostics easier to access may earn trust long after launch day.",
    whyItMatters:
      "A phone that is easy to repair can be cheaper over its full life. That matters more as flagship prices keep climbing.",
    body: [
      "The phone market is no longer only about launch specs. People are keeping devices longer, which means batteries, screens, and software support now shape the real cost of ownership.",
      "Repair networks are becoming a competitive advantage because they reduce anxiety. Buyers want to know what happens after a cracked display, a weak battery, or a charging port failure.",
      "The brands that treat repair as part of the product may end up looking more premium than brands that only win on launch-day hardware."
