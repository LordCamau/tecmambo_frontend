        <span>
          We're the tech publication for everyone the other tech sites forgot to write for, without boring the people who already love this stuff.

        <h2>Why we exist</h2>
        <p>
          Most tech writing assumes you already speak tech. It tosses around "ProMotion," "LTPO," and "tensor cores" like everyone got the
          memo. tecMAMBO started because too many smart, curious people, the ones spending real money on these devices, were quietly left
          out of the conversation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Founded in <strong>2016 by Tim Humphreys in Nairobi</strong>, tecMAMBO set out to be the <strong>translation layer</strong>:
          plain English first, the deep technical detail there when you want it, out of your way when you don't.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bet was simple, and a little contrarian: <em>you can make technology genuinely clear without dumbing it down.</em> Clarity
          isn't the absence of depth. It's depth you can actually follow.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className={`readable ${styles.section}`}>
        <h2>Why "tecMAMBO"?</h2>
        <p>
          <em>Mambo</em> is Swahili for <strong>things, matters, what's going on</strong>, and "Mambo?" is how friends greet each other
          across East Africa: <em>"what's up?"</em> tecMAMBO is exactly that, what's up in tech, explained the way a good friend would
          explain it. <strong>Tech + mambo.</strong> Warm, not stiff. Rooted right here, useful everywhere.

        <div className={styles.sectionHead}>
          <h2>How we make tech make sense</h2>
          <p>
            Every story works on two levels at once: clear for someone who's never heard the jargon, and substantial for someone who
            reviews phones for fun. That's the whole craft. We tell it in a few honest formats:
          </p>

        <div className={styles.formatGrid}>
          {formats.map((format) => (

            </Link>

        </div>
        <p className={styles.closingLine}>
          And the <Link href="/glossary">Glossary</Link>, a plain-English dictionary wired into every article, so a hard word is never a
          dead end.

      <section className={`readable ${styles.section}`}>
        <h2>Where we're headed</h2>
        <p>
          A world where understanding technology isn't a privilege reserved for the already-fluent. We want tecMAMBO to be the place
          anyone, from a first-time smartphone buyer in Kisumu to a developer in Berlin, comes to <em>actually understand</em> the tech
          shaping their life, and leaves feeling smarter and calmer, not smaller.

          tecMAMBO is funded by advertising, affiliate links, and clearly-labelled partner content. Three rules keep that clean: we{" "}

          <strong>reviews are written before, and independently of, any commercial conversation.</strong> If we recommend it, it earned the
